This is shown by an extra flare of creativity and colour in this city's borough. It's common to see the streets around the 'Custard Factory' bustling with activity and a weekend street-food market. The Old Crown is in the area, too. It's the city's oldest building and today a popular music venue. Digbeth was previously home to manufacturing facilities, tanneries, and blacksmith shops. Now, they house film production, digital creative agencies, and a gaming company.<br /><br />Less than a 20-minute walk to the UK's largest in-city shopping centre, The Bullring, sports and leisure facilities. Digbeth is home to excellent inner and outer city connections.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>PROPERTY HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Located in Birmingham&rsquo;s hub for regeneration\\n Bright and spacious One &amp;
